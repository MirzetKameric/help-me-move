# App improvements
- Create an API that clint application can communicate with, from there we can manage all external and internal APIs, and not from client side
- Add search option on location selector so that user can select every location in the world. 
- One issue with this search based on weather and flights APIs is that both of them have unique IDs that need to be used to get the data, therefore it might be better to have our own locations list that can be queried
- Selecting multiple options on where they want to live, so that it is easy for user to compare two or more locations to one another
- Display more weather info - mostly about yearly average temperature, weather patterns etc.
- Display more flights info based on filters user can select, for now I just define hard-coded default values
- Create more pages for buying tickets since flight API enables that
- Better error handling and display of errors
- Eventually expand this with authentication and other user based features. That way we can build more things for users and have all the data on our side. Also have users come back. For example, we can add apartment finder and also manage that on our side.
